### SLA
SLA is an initialism for *Service Level Agreement*. This is an agreement between a service provider and a client (where both could be inside the same organization/company) that defines what services the provider will provide to the client and in what manner.

An SLA may say that a provider will host a website, and further require the website will have a certain uptime (say, 99% of the time).
